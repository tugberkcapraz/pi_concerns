# Modelling Concerns About Personal Information with Structural Equation Modelling

This repo contains the code for my medium [post](LINK HERE). 

## Contents of the Repo
1) [The jupyter notebook](https://github.com/tugberkcapraz/pi_concerns/blob/main/Post.ipynb) contains the code and
explanations of my design choices. 
2) [Europinions.pdf](https://github.com/tugberkcapraz/pi_concerns/blob/main/europinions.pdf) is the file that you can 
find the survey report and the questionnaire that I used in this project. As
you see in the notebook, the variable naming convention of the market research company who conducted this survey is
really vague and _it is almost impossible to work without referring to this document._
3) [plots](https://github.com/tugberkcapraz/pi_concerns/tree/main/plots) is the directory where I saved the plots for further use.
4) **[sem_report](https://github.com/tugberkcapraz/pi_concerns/tree/main/sem_report)** is the report that is automatically created by semopy package. 


## Notes:

I don't provide the dataset here for two reasons. 
1) The data is in .dta (Stata format) format and it is over 100 mb. Github complains about it. Even though there are ways to bypass this
I don't think it makes sense to upload that big file here.
2) I downloaded the data from [GESIS](LINK HERE) archive and anyone who creates a free account on their website can access the files
just like I did. They want to know which accounts download their data for what purposes and I respect their decision. So 
you can follow that link and download the data by yourself.
