# Modelling Concerns About Personal Information

This repo contains the code for my medium [post](LINK HERE). 

## Structure
1) [The jupyter notebook](https://github.com/tugberkcapraz/pi_concerns/blob/main/Post.ipynb) contains the code and explanations of my design choices. 
2) [Europinions.pdf](https://github.com/tugberkcapraz/pi_concerns/blob/main/europinions.pdf) is the file that you can find the survey report and the questionnaire that I used in this project. As
you see in the notebook, the variable naming convention of the market research company who conducted this survey is
really vague and it is almost impossible to work without referring to this document.
3) [plots](https://github.com/tugberkcapraz/pi_concerns/tree/main/plots) is the directory where I saved the plots
4) **[sem_report](https://github.com/tugberkcapraz/pi_concerns/tree/main/sem_report)**
